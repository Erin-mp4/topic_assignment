            <h2>Coining the Term</h2>
            <p>Take a look back at 1921, at the first instance of the word "robot." Karl Capek and his play, Rossum's Universal Robots, took existing ideas and turned them into the machines we see today. His play, which features robots realizing their own strength and autonomy in relation to their human masters.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Mainstream</h2>
            <p>Before the likes of Star Wars and Terminator brought robots to a wider audience, a number of sci-fi authors were speculating about the concept of autonomous machines. Today, Asimov's laws of robotics and Phillip K Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep are foundational touchstones for robots in media.</p>
